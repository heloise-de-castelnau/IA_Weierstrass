# PROJECT REPORT : IA_Weierstrass

## Subject
Astronomers have observed a new, unknown star. Their first observations let us believe that the temperature on its surface varies regularly with several periodicities such as
shown below.

</p>

Astronomers assume that the star follows a Weierstrass function with several nested periodicities in the fractal sense, that we define as :

 With  t(i) the temperature of the star at a given instant i and with the set of parameters:

</p>

The goal is to determine the combination (a, b, c) able of bringing the Weierstrass function closer to the temperature observations made at given times. A list
of observations was provided to me in the temperature sample.csv file where each line representsan observation. Each observation is made up of the time of observation as well as the observed temperature.
